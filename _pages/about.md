We do not hate the snowy plover. We do not stomp on plovers. We came up with the term “ploverstomp” to humorously describe a walk or run down the beach. Over many years, we have noticed changes along the shoreline, not the least of which is the incursion of man trying to protect the snowy plover. The energy and funding to support this endeavor is not justified by any rational science. In fact, a cogent argument can be made that man’s efforts to protect the snowy plover habitat are actually causing it more harm than if we just left it alone.

Access to the beaches have been restricted as part of the effort to protect the snowy plover. This result is not unique to the snowy plover. Ultimately, access is the issue at hand. PloverStomp.com is a site created to humorously picture the access issue, extend the awareness of the access issue - with the snowy plover as the first exemplary case, all with maintaining a realistic perspective based in science.
